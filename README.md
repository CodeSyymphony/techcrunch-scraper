## Introduction
`techcrunch-scraper` is a Django-based application designed to scrape and store articles from TechCrunch based on specific keywords.<!-- or categories --> It integrates Celery for task scheduling and Redis as a message broker, supporting asynchronous task processing.

## Installation
This project is containerized with Docker, ensuring a straightforward setup. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeSymphonyy/techcrunch-scraper.git
   cd techcrunch-scraper
   ```

2. Build and run the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Create a superuser account for Django admin:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password.

## Usage
Once the application is running, access the Django admin interface by navigating to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Use the superuser credentials you created to log in.

### Scrape TechCrunch
- Go to the Keywords section and click on 'SCRAPE NEW KEYWORDS'. Enter a search term and start the scraping task.

### Download Results
- After scraping, download links for the articles (by category or keyword) can be accessed on Articles linked in the admin dashboard.
There are two important actions for articles:
  - **Export articles by categories**
  - **Export articles by keyword**

### Monitoring Celery Tasks with Flower
- To monitor tasks, access the Flower dashboard by navigating to [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555). Flower provides a real-time view of the task queue, ongoing tasks, and task history.

## Features
- **Keyword-based scraping**: Scrape articles by specific keywords.
- **Data export**: Export scraped data in CSV and JSON formats, zipped for convenience.
- **Admin interface customization**: Custom Django admin actions and pages for better management.
<!-- - **Category-based scraping**: Automatically scrape articles by category at scheduled times. -->
## Dependencies
This project is built using:
- Django 4.2
- Celery
- Redis
- Docker and Docker Compose

See `requirements.txt` for a complete list of Python package dependencies.

## Configuration
Configuration is managed via Django's settings module and environment variables. Key settings include:
- `DEBUG` mode
- Database configuration
- Celery configuration

Adjust settings in `local_settings.py` and `.env` files as needed.

### Setting Up Configuration Files

1. **Local Settings**:
   - A sample configuration file `sample_settings.py` is provided as a template.
   - Copy `sample_settings.py` to `local_settings.py` and modify it according to your local environment.
   - This file should not be committed to version control as it contains settings specific to your environment.

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - A sample environment file `.env.sample` is provided.
   - Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and adjust the variables to suit your deployment needs.
   - The `.env` file will contain sensitive information such as database configurations and secret keys, hence it should also not be committed to your version control system.

## Documentation
Additional documentation detailing API endpoints, modules, and tasks is available under the `docs/` directory (if applicable).

## Troubleshooting
- **Celery tasks not running**: Ensure the Redis service is running and reachable.
- **Static files not found**: Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to collect static files into the static directory.
